        <p>
          Crosshair placement is a fundamental skill in tactical shooter games where you position 
          your crosshair to anticipate enemy locations, aiming at head-level and slightly away from corners 
          to minimize reaction time. Key techniques include practicing headshot positions, tracking edges of corners, 
          holding off-angles, and understanding how distance and elevation affect where to place your crosshair.

          Understanding the structure of each map and knowing common locations is a key factor in achieving success. 
          Dedicate time to studying each map, learn local terms, and develop a sense of the game to anticipate enemy movements. 
          Map knowledge can give you an advantage and help you make informed decisions during matches.

          The first and crucial point is understanding agents. Valorant offers a diverse
          list of characters, each with unique abilities and playstyles. As a beginner
          player, dedicate time to familiarize yourself with different agents and their
          abilities. Experiment to find those that match your preferred playstyle,
          whether it's an aggressive approach or a supportive role; there's an agent for
          every player.
