                <h2>JETT</h2>
                <p>To play Jett effectivelty, focus on being an aggressive entry fragger who creates space for the
                    team.
                    always active your dash before peeking so you can safely escape after taking a shot, and use your
                    smoke to
                    block sightlines or cover your movement when pushing or retreating. Combine updraft with your
                    ultimate
                    to suprise enemies from unexpected angles, especially during eco rounds. Take advantage of Jett's
                    mobility
                    to hold off-angles, get to high ground, and quickly reposition after engagements. Most importantly,
                    communicate with your team, don't waste abilities, and remember that good Jett players are
                    disciplined
                    with aggression, not reckless.

                <h2>SAGE</h2>
                <p>When playing Sage, focus on supporting your team through healing, slowing enemies, and controlling
                    space
                    with your wall. Use your Healing Orb wisely—prioritize teammates in clutch positions or heal
                    yourself to stay
                    alive longer. Place Slow Orbs in choke points or during retakes to delay pushes and make it easier
                    to win
                    duels. Your Barrier Orb (wall) is one of the most powerful tools in the game use it to block
                    entries, boost
                    yourself to off-angles, or stall defuses/plants. During post-plant situations, wall the spike to
                    force enemies to
                    shoot or walk around it, buying time. Always stay alive in the late round when possible, as your
                    utility
                    becomes even more valuable for clutch situations.</p>

                <h2>BRIMSTONE</h2>
                <p>When playing Brimstone, your main job is to control the map with smokes and support your team with
                    well-
                    timed utility. Use your Sky Smokes to cut off enemy sightlines during executes or retakes—always
                    smoke
                    key choke points and common angles to make site entry safer. Brimstone’s Incendiary (molly) is
                    perfect for
                    post-plant lineups or flushing enemies out of tight spots, so learn common molly lineups for each
                    map. Use
                    your Stim Beacon before fights or rushes to give your team faster fire rate and an edge in duels. In
                    clutch
                    situations, play for post-plant molly damage and don’t waste your smokes early—saving one for retake
                    or
                    stall can win rounds. Brim is best when played with good timing, map knowledge, and strong
                    communication.

                <h2>SOVA</h2>
                <p>When playing Sova, your main strength is gathering intel and enabling your team with recon and
                    utility. Use
                    your Recon Bolt to reveal enemies before site executes or to check common hiding spots—bounce it off
                    walls to make it harder to destroy. Learn lineups for both Recon and Shock Darts on every map,
                    especially
                    for post-plant damage or delaying defuses. Shock Darts can also be used to clear corners or chip
                    damage
                    early in rounds. Your Owl Drone is great for safely clearing space—tag enemies when you can, but
                    even just
                    spotting them gives your team an advantage. In clutch rounds, play smart and use utility before
                    peeking
                    Sova’s value increases the longer he stays alive and gathers information.</p>
